I"+"<p>So. Hello! I’m Jack. And as it may or may not be obvious, this is my first blog post. I don’t want
to detract from the contents of this post too much, but I figured it’s at least worth a brief
explanation as to <em>why</em> I’m making it.</p>

<p>First, this is a response to the Rust <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2020/09/03/Planning-2021-Roadmap.html">call for blog posts</a>
for 2021. Now, I do co-lead the <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/wg-traits/">traits working group</a> and
have contributed to <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/chalk">Chalk</a> a fair bit over the past year. But,
I do want to put a disclaimer that <em>the points I may make in this post are my own and I’m not
speaking in any “official” capacity here</em>. I wanted to make this post in case others find my
thoughts useful. And, frankly, I figured it would be fun.</p>

<p>Well, onto the contents of the post itself.</p>

<h1 id="background">Background</h1>

<p>Okay, let’s start with some background. My day job is actually being a graduate student
studying bioinformatics. In this field, it’s really a mixed bag of programming languages that you
see. Python and bash/shell scripts are extremely common for data munging, processing, etc. Python
also is used often for machine learning. R is used often for plotting, but also some data analysis.
Anytime you need more raw performance, you see a <em>lot</em> of C or sometimes C++. In the work I do, I
also heavily use Javscript/Typescript for web development, with a mixing of Kotlin. I use Rust for
one (unreleased) project, but that’s all so far.</p>

<p>A lot of the libraries and software for bioinformatics are used <em>because other people use them</em>;
they’ve been peer-reviewed and published, and as more people use them, the more of the <em>de facto</em>
standard they become. This isn’t bad necessarily: there are plenty of libraries and software that
is well-maintained, with easily-accesibly source code, that does exactly what you need it to do.
But, there are also plenty of libraries and software that isn’t well-maintained, the source is hard
to find, or you need it to do something different.</p>

<p>Now, you might be asking: “how does this relate to Rust?” Well, in a way, it does and it doesn’t.
In some sense, the conclusion from the past couple paragraphs is “I want more libraries and software
for bioinformatics written in Rust.” But <em>why</em>? If you think the answer is “because I like the
language and like writing in it”, you would be partially correct. But, really, it’s because that I
think Rust has a lot to offer here:</p>

<p>Python and bash are generally okay for data munging and processing, but sometimes you really just
want some <em>type safety</em>. R is generally excellent for plotting, but…well I’m not even going to try
to list all the issues here. As far as data analysis tools written in R: have you ever had to hunt
down documentation, unsure of what exactly that function does? Something like rustdoc would be great
here. Performance-sensitive libraries and software are where I feel like Rust will shine the most;
I would probably be preaching to the choir here if I started to list off reasons why. And finally,
for web development related work, particularly server-side, it would be great to have better
predictability for the memory and CPU requirements needed.</p>

<p>Eek, that was a longer background than I expected. I guess the tldr is: I like Rust and I think it’s
a language that offers a lot of promise for many different types of applications. But, at least for
bioinformatics, there’s more work to be done to build up libraries.</p>

<h1 id="rust-2021">Rust 2021</h1>

<p>Now it’s time for the meat and potatoes: what I want to see from the Rust programming language in 2021.
I already mentioned in my background that I feel like more <strong>libraries</strong> are needed in Rust,
particularly around bioinformatics. But, in my opinion, <em>that will come in time</em>, and there’s not
much that can be done other than making the language something that the people <em>writing</em> those
libraries want to write in.</p>

<p>What I do want to talk about can maybe summed up into a single word:
<strong>stability</strong>. Now, this is very much a loaded word: I’m not referring only to
Rust’s <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2014/10/30/Stability.html">stability guarantee</a>;
I’m not referring only to libraries moving from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0.*</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1.*</code> versions; I’m not
referring to only stabilizing nightly features. I’m referring to all of that and
more. So let’s dive in.</p>

<h2 id="maturity-as-stability">Maturity as stability</h2>

<p>I recently saw a reddit post of someone asking about Rust’s stability. But, in
their post, they also said a different word: <em>mature</em>. What exactly <em>is</em> a
mature language? A mature library? Something that doesn’t add many new features?
Well, then surely C++ wouldn’t be called mature then (since there are numerous
new features in C++20, for example). One that doesn’t have a lot of bugs? Well,
good luck.</p>

<p>One way you could imagine maturity is like this: If the maintainers of the
language or library stopped working on it <em>today</em>, how bad would that be.
Under this definition, you can imagine something like the C language being very
mature; the core language hasn’t change much in a long time. A library that has
been written and does everything it’s supposed to without (more than perhaps a 
couple) bugs is probably considered mature. C++11? Probably mature. C++20?
Probably not. Mature is <em>relative</em> and it’s <em>subjective</em>.</p>

<p>Maturity in a language is important. If you ask the question: “is this language
going to be around in 20 years”, the list of languages that you would feel a
confident “yes” for is probably small. In my opinion, Rust isn’t <em>quite</em> there,
<em>yet</em>. But what are some things that can be done to bring us there?</p>

<p>First, let’s think about the standard library. I want to make sure before I go
forward that the number of different APIs in std doesn’t exactly indicate it’s
maturity or not: a standard library with “all the batteries” doesn’t mean it’s
stable and a standard library without them doesn’t mean it’s not. Instead, std
maturity is more about having better knowledge of what programming patterns are
used often enough that they <em>should</em> be in std; and importantly, what <em>shouldn’t</em>
be. There are plenty of unstable library features where it’s up in the air
whether they should be stabilized or removed. And there are plenty of “wanted”
features that just aren’t in std yet. This is not to say there won’t <em>always</em>
be <em>some</em> API that someone wants, but I do feel like we’re still not quite
“mature”. Quick point though, I would say that 98% of the current std <em>is</em>
excellent and probably falls under the “mature” category.</p>

<p>Next, we can think about language features. There are number of features people
want to see: GATs, const generics, specialization all come to mind. In some form
or another, these each have <em>partial</em> implementations. There are other areas of
the language where the design hasn’t even been decided on. (See the RFC
repository). Maturity here means pushing these language features through. It
means stabilizing pieces that work (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">min_const_generics</code> or
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">min_specialization</code>). It means working through the design of interacting with
bits and pieces of the language that today are somewhat “magic” (e.g.
traits/vtables or dynamically sized types). Of course, this can’t all happen in
2021, but that’s okay. It’s much better to get these designs <em>right</em> than to get
them <em>fast</em>. In 20 years, it isn’t going to matter if we had these features in
2021 or 2023.</p>

<h2 id="librarification-as-stability">Librarification as stability</h2>

<p>Before I continue with this, I do want to point out that Niko Matsakis
previously wrote a <a href="http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2020/04/09/libraryification/">great blog post</a>
covering some of this earlier this year. As he put it, “the basic idea is to refactor the compiler
into a set of <em>independent libraries</em>, all knit together by the query system.” In my view, this is
super important. In the blog post, he covers two points: first, librarification can mean that tools</p>
