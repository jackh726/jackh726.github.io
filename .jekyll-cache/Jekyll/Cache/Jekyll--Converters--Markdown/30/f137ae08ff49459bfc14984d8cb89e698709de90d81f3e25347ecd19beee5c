<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Jack. Iâ€™m currently a graduate student studying bioinformatics. One of
areas Iâ€™m particularly focused on is (biological) data processing,
visualization, and accessibility. Additionally, I do a lot of integrative analysis work on the integration of
many different types and sources of data.</p>

<p>In my free time, Iâ€™m on involved in the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust programming language</a>.
There, Iâ€™m heavily involved in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/chalk">Chalk</a> and
co-lead the <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/wg-traits/">traits working group</a>.</p>
