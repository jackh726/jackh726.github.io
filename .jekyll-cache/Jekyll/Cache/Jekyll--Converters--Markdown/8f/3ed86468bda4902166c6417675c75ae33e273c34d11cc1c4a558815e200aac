I"¨<p>So. Hello! Iâ€™m Jack. And as it may or may not be obvious, this is my first blog post. I donâ€™t want
to detract from the contents of this post too much, but I figured itâ€™s at least worth a brief
explanation as to <em>why</em> Iâ€™m making it.</p>

<p>First, this is a response to the Rust <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2020/09/03/Planning-2021-Roadmap.html">call for blog posts</a>
for 2021. Now, I do co-lead the <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/wg-traits/">traits working group</a> and
have contributed to <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/chalk">Chalk</a> a fair bit over the past year. But,
I do want to put a disclaimer that <em>the points I may make in this post are my own and Iâ€™m not
speaking in any â€œofficialâ€ capacity here</em>. I wanted to make this post in case others find my
thoughts useful. And, frankly, I figured it would be fun.</p>

<p>Well, onto the contents of the post itself.</p>

<h1 id="background">Background</h1>

<p>Okay, letâ€™s start with some background. My day job is actually being a graduate student
studying bioinformatics. In this field, itâ€™s really a mixed bag of programming languages that you
see. Python and bash/shell scripts are extremely common for data munging, processing, etc. Python
also is used often for machine learning. R is used often for plotting, but also some data analysis.
Anytime you need more raw performance, you see a <em>lot</em> of C or sometimes C++. In the work I do, I
also heavily use Javscript/Typescript for web development, with a mixing of Kotlin. I use Rust for
one (unreleased) project, but thatâ€™s all so far.</p>

<p>A lot of the libraries and software for bioinformatics are used <em>because other people use them</em>;
theyâ€™ve been peer-reviewed and published, and as more people use them, the more of the <em>de facto</em>
standard they become. This isnâ€™t bad necessarily: there are plenty of libraries and software that
is well-maintained, with easily-accesibly source code, that does exactly what you need it to do.
But, there are also plenty of libraries and software that isnâ€™t well-maintained, the source is hard
to find, or you need it to do something different.</p>

<p>Now, you might be asking: â€œhow does this relate to Rust?â€ Well, in a way, it does and it doesnâ€™t.
In some sense, the conclusion from the past couple paragraphs is â€œI want more libraries and software
for bioinformatics written in Rust.â€ But <em>why</em>? If you think the answer is â€œbecause I like the
language and like writing in itâ€, you would be partially correct. But, really, itâ€™s because that I
think Rust has a lot to offer here:</p>

<p>Python and bash are generally okay for data munging and processing, but sometimes you really just
want some <em>type safety</em>. R is generally excellent for plotting, butâ€¦well Iâ€™m not even going to try
to list all the issues here. As far as data analysis tools written in R: have you ever had to hunt
down documentation, unsure of what exactly that function does? Something like rustdoc would be great
here. Performance-sensitive libraries and software are where I feel like Rust will shine the most;
I would probably be preaching to the choir here if I started to list off reasons why. And finally,
for web development related work, particularly server-side, it would be great to have better
predictability for the memory and CPU requirements needed.</p>

<p>Eek, that was a longer background than I expected. I guess the tldr is: I like Rust and I think itâ€™s
a language that offers a lot of promise for many different types of applications. But, at least for
bioinformatics, thereâ€™s more work to be done to build up libraries.</p>

<h1 id="rust-2021">Rust 2021</h1>

<p>Now itâ€™s time for the meat and potatoes: what I want to see from the Rust programming language in 2021.
I already mentioned in my background that I feel like more <strong>libraries</strong> are needed in Rust,
particularly around bioinformatics. But, in my opinion, <em>that will come in time</em>, and thereâ€™s not
much that can be done other than making the language something that the people <em>writing</em> those
libraries want to write in.</p>

<p>What I do want to talk about can maybe summed up into a single word:
<strong>stability</strong>. Now, this is very much a loaded word: Iâ€™m not referring only to
Rustâ€™s <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2014/10/30/Stability.html">stability guarantee</a>;
Iâ€™m not referring only to libraries moving from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0.*</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1.*</code> versions; Iâ€™m not
referring to only stabilizing nightly features. Iâ€™m referring to all of that and
more. So letâ€™s dive in.</p>

<h2 id="maturity-as-stability">Maturity as stability</h2>

<p>I recently saw a reddit post of someone asking about Rustâ€™s stability. But, in
their post, they also said a different word: <em>mature</em>. What exactly <em>is</em> a
mature language? A mature library? Something that doesnâ€™t add many new features?
Well, then surely C++ wouldnâ€™t be called mature then (since there are numerous
new features in C++20, for example). One that doesnâ€™t have a lot of bugs? Well,
good luck.</p>

<p>One way you could imagine maturity is like this: If the maintainers of the
language or library stopped working on it <em>today</em>, how bad would that be.
Under this definition, you can imagine something like the C language being very
mature; the core language hasnâ€™t change much in a long time. A library that has
been written and does everything itâ€™s supposed to without (more than perhaps a 
couple) bugs is probably considered mature. C++11? Probably mature. C++20?
Probably not. Mature is <em>relative</em> and itâ€™s <em>subjective</em>.</p>

<p>Maturity in a language is important. If you ask the question: â€œis this language
going to be around in 20 yearsâ€, the list of languages that you would feel a
confident â€œyesâ€ for is probably small. In my opinion, Rust isnâ€™t <em>quite</em> there,
<em>yet</em>. But what are some things that can be done to bring us there?</p>

<p>First, letâ€™s think about the standard library. I want to make sure before I go
forward that the number of different APIs in std doesnâ€™t exactly indicate itâ€™s
maturity or not: a standard library with â€œall the batteriesâ€ doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s
stable and a standard library without them doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s not. Instead, std
maturity is more about recognizing what APIs should and shouldnâ€™t be added.</p>
