## About me

Hi, I'm Jack.


I finished my Ph.D. in Biomedical Sciences in July 2025. My interests largely cover how the genome is regulated through
chromatin accesibility, conformation, and binding. Though, my thesis work was studying the role of the Grainyhead-like
family in the mouse thymus. I also spend a considerable time thinking about (biological) data processing, visulaization,
and accesibility.

For much of my Ph.D., in my free time, and in the time since, I've been heavily involved in the
[Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/), focusing heavily on the type system and on Project governance.
I co-lead the types team and am a compiler team maintainer. I also co-lead the
[vision doc work](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2025/04/04/vision-doc-survey/).
