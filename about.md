## About me

Hi, I'm Jack. I'm currently a graduate student studying bioinformatics. One of
areas I'm particularly focused on is (biological) data processing,
visualization, and accessibility. Additionally, I do a lot of integrative
analysis using different types of biological data.

In my free time, I'm on involved in the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
There, I'm heavily involved in [Chalk](https://github.com/rust-lang/chalk) and
co-lead the [traits working group](https://rust-lang.github.io/wg-traits/).
